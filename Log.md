# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 0 : July 22 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I have setup all the things I needed to complete this challenge and also chosen 2 courses which I like to complete it by end of this challenge.
* From [Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
* From [Google ML Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/)

**Thoughts** : Hope this will be exiciting ,will help me in learning Machine Learning in a more effective way .

## Day 1 : July 23 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : From [Google ML Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/) Finished till Gradient descent.

**Thoughts** : Learnt about the supervised learning, especially about regression problems.

## Day 2 : July 24 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : {Andrew Ng's third week} Notion of Classification, the cost function for Logistic Regression and application of logistic regressionto multi-class classification.

**Thoughts** : Learnt the math behind why logistic regression is used in classification problems.

## Day 3 : July 25 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : {Andrew Ng's third week - Finished} Concept of underfitting and overfitting. Regularization as a way to avoid overfitting. How to apply regularization in linear and logistic regression.

**Thoughts** : Completed with linear classifiers. Next stuff, non-linear classifiers like neural networks. Excited.

## Day 4 : July 26 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : {Andrew Ng's fourth week} Started with Neural Networks theory and model representation.

**Thoughts** : Neural network is synonym to brain functionality.

## Day 5 : July 27 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : {Andrew Ng's fourth week} Continuing with Neural Networks. Examples that illustrate how neural network is used to compute non-linear decision boundary's.
